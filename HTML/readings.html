        In Susan Sontag’s famous essay "In Plato’s Cave," she argues that modern people are still trapped in a cave of illusions, preferring mere images of the truth over reality itself. For me, capturing images and creating graphics is a way to navigate this environment where everything has been turned into a set of potential photographs. Sontag explains that photography is an acquisitive act; to take a photo is to appropriate the subject, creating a relationship that feels like knowledge and power. As I begin these nine projects, I want to avoid being a chronic voyeur whose work simply levels the meaning of all events. Instead, I see these projects as a way to learn a new grammar and an ethics of seeing. By treating my assignments as a connected body of work rather than just slices of time, I can move beyond sentimentalism and try to reach a deeper understanding. Sontag argues that true understanding comes from explaining how things function in time, not just how they look on the surface.

To represent our world today—which Sontag calls atomic, manageable, and opaque—I want to combine photography with text. Our current moment is defined by a compulsion to photograph where we feel that an experience isn't real until we have a picture of it. My strategy would involve cropping, retouching, and doctoring images to show that they are not perfect pieces of reality. By adding text, I can provide the narrative that Sontag says photos lack on their own. If everything exists to end in a photograph, I want my work to be more than just mental pollution. I want to use the camera to dignify my subjects through careful attention. Ultimately, I want to bridge the gap between just seeing an image and actually understanding the world. Sontag notes that photos can anesthetize us or make us stop caring if we see too many of them. By being more intentional with how I frame my subjects, I hope to create images that encourage people to think and speculate rather than just consume. As Sontag says, understanding starts when we don't just accept the world as it looks.
