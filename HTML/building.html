    <h1>Building Architecture</h1>   
    <p> This photograph focuses on a building where I tried to capture the small architectural details rather than the whole structure. I cropped image 5x7. 
      By paying attention to lines, textures, and patterns, the image highlights the character of the building and how these details give it depth and personality.</p>
