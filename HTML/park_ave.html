    <h1>Park Avenue Traffic</h1>   
    <p> This photograph captures Park Avenue in the middle of the day, where traffic flows steadily and people pass by without pause. 
      The scene reflects the everyday rhythm of the city—cars moving, pedestrians crossing, and life continuing without interruption. 
      Rather than focusing on a single subject, the image emphasizes movement and the shared space between people and the city. Pictue is in dimension of 1920 x 1080, and resolution is 70. </p>
